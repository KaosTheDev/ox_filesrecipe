ox_core recipe
Recipe for deploying a basic ox_core server through txAdmin.
This recipe is a work in progress, as are many of the resources packaged with it; parts are definitely broken.

Feel free to report issues but do not expect any support at this stage, this is not production ready by any means.

This recipe is provided as a courtesey and is not recommended.
Manually setting up your server with git allows for version control and merging changes.

Installation
Open the txAdmin web panel and begin deployment.
Select "Remote URL Template", and paste the link below into the text field.
